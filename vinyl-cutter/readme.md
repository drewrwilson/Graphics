# What is this?
`default.svg` is a default layout for InkScape that is prepped for the vinyl-cutter machine. When installed to InkScape it will set the default units to inches, it will set the size of the document to be 24"x40" and it has a sample sticker in the upper left corner to remind people to place their design in that location.

# How do I install this?

Here is a blog post that explains how to install it: http://libregraphicsworld.org/blog/entry/using-templates-in-inkscape

## Windows

 * Copy `default.svg` to `%APPDATA%\\Inkscape\templates\`
 * Restart InkScape. Now the default new document should be the vinyl one

## MacOS

 * Copy `default.svg` to `~/.config/inkscape/templates/`


## Linux
Idk, if you're using Linux you probably like figuring stuff out... so if you figure it out, maybe update this readme doc?
